# Xero-codee FE task using React + TypeScript + Vite

Start date: February 6th, 2024.
End date: Deadline day (February 10th) 2024.

## Challenges faced

This is a simple landing page design and there were no challenges at all.

## Design decisions

-- For a simple landing page, I have decided to use reactTs and not next so as to `KISS(keep It Simple, Stupid)` and not over engineer a simple app.

-- TailwindCss for styling and a few animations.

-- Animate on Scroll library for scroll animations.

-- Shadcn UI for carousel, mobile menu and translate dropdown.
(This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps). I have used this to have `DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)` code

## Testing??

-- I have not used any functions in this simple landing page design so there was no need performing any tests. Again, from my experience one should never over engineer simple things.
